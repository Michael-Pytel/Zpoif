# Advanced Object Oriented and Functional Programming Course

🚀 These are most of my attempts to solve scored laboratories for my uni course! All of the projects are in folders with corresponding number. All of the tasks are in Polish but below is a short translation of the most important paradigms that I learned during this course.

## Static, Anonymous, and Inner Classes

Explore my implementation of static, anonymous, and inner classes, showcasing skills in improving code organization, encapsulation, and reusability. 

## Lambda Expressions

Utilization of lambda expressions to write concise, readable, and efficient code. I used interfaces known as Consumer, Supplier, etc..

## Streams

Processing sequences of elements in a functional style using Java streams. These projects illustrate how I harness the power of streams to enhance code readability and improve performance.

## Reflections

Elements of dynamic code inspection and manipulation. Reflective showcases my ability to utilize reflections for creating flexible and extensible applications.

## Annotations

On these scored tasks I got familiar with annotations which later I used in my Spring boot project.
