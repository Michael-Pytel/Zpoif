## Static, Anonymous, and Inner Classes

Explore my implementation of static, anonymous, and inner classes, showcasing skills in improving code organization, encapsulation, and reusability. 

## Lambda Expressions

Utilization of lambda expressions to write concise, readable, and efficient code. I used interfaces known as Consumer, Supplier, etc..

## Streams

Processing sequences of elements in a functional style using Java streams. These projects illustrate how I harness the power of streams to enhance code readability and improve performance.

## Reflections

Elements of dynamic code inspection and manipulation. Reflective showcases my ability to utilize reflections for creating flexible and extensible applications.

## Annotations

On these scored tasks I got familiar with annotations which later I used in my Spring boot project.
